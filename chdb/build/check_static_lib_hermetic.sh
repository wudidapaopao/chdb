# Release gates for the static library.
#
# libchdb.so gates its exported surface at link time. libchdb.a is handed to a linker we do
# not control, so the gate has to be baked into the objects
# (cmake/bundled_runtime_visibility.cmake). These checks verify that it was.
#
#   Gate 1  nothing in the probe can bind the bundled runtime to the system runtime
#   Gate 2  the bundled runtime objects export nothing at all
#   Gate 3a the two checked-in export allow-lists describe the same C API contract
#   Gate 3b every symbol in that contract is still reachable from libchdb.a
#   Gate 4  the linked probe connects and runs a query
#   Gate 5  the archive does not override libc's posix_spawn
#
# Gates 1 to 4 are the same on both platforms; only the tools and the condition that
# exposes the hazard differ. Gate 5 has nothing to find on macOS - base/glibc-compatibility
# is a Linux-only target - but its behavioural half is a real check there too, and it is
# the half that keeps working if the archive is ever assembled a different way.
#
#   Mach-O  weak definitions that stay external land in the export trie and dyld may bind
#           them to the system libc++/libc++abi. Exposed by a deployment target of 12.0 or
#           newer, which is when ld starts emitting chained fixups: measured against a
#           pre-fix arm64 archive, min=10.15 produced no coalescing records at all while
#           12.0 and up produced 33102.
#   ELF     default-visibility definitions reach .dynsym and become interposable. A plain
#           executable link does not expose them, `-rdynamic` does, so the probe is linked
#           that way deliberately as the ELF equivalent of a modern deployment target.
#
# Gate 1 deliberately does not parse `dyld_info -fixups`. Its `<weak-def-coalesce>` marker
# text is dyld-version specific - on a macOS 14 runner the same hardened archive that yields
# 32779 records locally yields none, which would have reported a vacuous pass. It compares
# symbol sets instead, using only nm/readelf.
#
# Note both platforms need a visibility-aware tool: a hidden symbol is still a global
# definition in the symbol table on Mach-O and ELF alike, so plain `nm -g` cannot see the
# difference and would report a hardened archive as unprotected.
#
# Every extraction step below is checked for tool failure separately from its result being
# empty. An empty result is what a clean archive looks like, so conflating the two lets a
# broken `dyld_info` or `readelf` invocation pass the gates vacuously.
